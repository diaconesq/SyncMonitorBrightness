# SyncMonitorBrightness
Apply the brightness setting in Windows to all monitors.

I can control the brightness of my laptop with the built-in Windows 10 brightness setting, or using the specialized buttons on the laptop.

However, it has no effect on additional monitors attached to the laptop via e.g. a docking station.

This program lives in the system tray and "copies" the brightness of the built-in monitor to the additional monitors.

As an added benefit, if the built-in monitor has an ambient light sensor and is configured to dynamically adjust its brightness, 
the additional monitor(s) will continue to adjust their brightness to match.

To exit, right-click the tray icon and click 'Exit'.
